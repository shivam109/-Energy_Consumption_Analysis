# -Energy_Consumption_Analysis
#Problem Statement:
The project will analyze energy usage and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of Ontario's Broader Public Sector (BPS) organizations, leveraging a comprehensive database of reported data. We aim to identify trends, assess conservation effectiveness, and pinpoint areas for improvement, informing data-driven strategies to achieve climate change mitigation goals within the BPS.

#Data Understanding:
